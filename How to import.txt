to import this file you can put it in the same directory as your .py file is
but this is not certain to work always and you may want to use it in all of your projects
in that case go to:
C:/Users/$username$/AppData/Local/Programs/(Python)/Python$version-subversion$/Lib/
And put it in there!
Also the (Python) is for the fact that you may not have this folder!
