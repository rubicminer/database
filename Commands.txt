Commands for now

database.declare(file)
So basically this command finds the database you wanna use, it must be in the same folder your .py file is if you're just entering the name
if it's not you need to give the exact directory
database.declare("File.txt")
database.declare("C:/Users/rubicminer/Appdata/Local/File.txt")
Obviously my file is not there, just an example!

database.read()
it will read the content of the database

database.write(text)
Will write a new thing into your database

database.overwrite(text)
Like database.write(text), just that this time it will overwrite your file

database.clear()
Will clear every data on your database

database.remove()
Will remove the database from your computer
